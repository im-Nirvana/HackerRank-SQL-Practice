# HackerRank-SQL-Practice

/*

Here you'll  find SQL codes related to 
the challenges available on hacker rank under the title  
"SQL challenges/ Practice".
My only advice is to use it only as a reference and not to 
copy it! As this code will  be available always but you can
learn it only by practice and practice alone, as well said that
"Therre is no  alternative to hard work."
Try your best if you're struck, refer the code and again try
it on your own.
All the best with your practice!
